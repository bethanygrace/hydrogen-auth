# Hydrogen Auth Plugin

A brute-force approach to remote gateway authentication.

This package for [Atom](https://atom.io/), is a plugin for [Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen).

It allows connecting to password-protected notebook servers and gateways. However, the approach taken to achieve this involves some heavy monkey-patching. There is no guarantee that it won't break other atom packages.
